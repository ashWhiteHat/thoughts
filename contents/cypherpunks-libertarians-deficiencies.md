# Cypherpunks and Libertarians: Deficiencies in Activities and Unresolved Issues

## Overview

The cypherpunk movement is a movement of technologists and thinkers who aim to protect individual privacy and freedom using cryptography, while preventing intervention by governments and large corporations. Rooted in libertarian thought—a philosophy that prioritizes individual freedom—this movement seeks to build a free and autonomous economic zone. However, achieving a sustainable economic zone requires the elimination of crime and the assurance of rational system use. To this end, it is necessary to clearly define the vision we aim for, establish rules prohibiting money laundering and illegal transactions, and incorporate rationality acceptable to society into the system design. This paper organizes the challenges of the cypherpunk movement—namely, diversity of thought, misuse of technology, and difficulties in adoption—and proposes directions for future discussions.

## Challenges Due to Diversity of Ideology

The cypherpunk movement has seen extensive discussions, yet its lack of uniformity has resulted in an absence of clear consensus on thought. Initially, David Chaum proposed a mechanism using cryptography to ensure privacy for managed data, countering surveillance and information asymmetry imposed by centralized systems. Later, Timothy May’s manifesto, infused with punk and anarchist elements, boldly asserted the goal of transforming governance through free internet transactions. In contrast, Eric Hughes’s manifesto emphasized the importance of privacy in an open society from a libertarian perspective, focusing on anonymous transactions enabled by cryptography. Meanwhile, Nick Szabo and Satoshi Nakamoto raised concerns about financial system issues like inflation and account freezes, dedicating their efforts to developing electronic currency.

Without a defined direction, evaluating progress becomes challenging, risking fragmentation of the movement and stagnation of activities. Even within the "cypherpunk" framework, perspectives vary widely, leading to discrepancies in system usage and design philosophy. For instance, the concept of "trustless" is interpreted differently—some trust only mathematical facts, others rely on economic rationality, and yet others depend on consensus among network participants. Such differences in design philosophy can cause inconsistencies in terminology, misuse, or excessive constraints, potentially undermining the system’s intended operation. Additionally, while libertarian ideology holds that “you can do anything as long as you don't bother others,” Timothy May's manifesto hints that even criminals can be used as a driving force for the movement. For sustainable progress, it is critical to clarify what is permitted and what is prohibited, strengthening the link between design philosophy and technology to promote the system’s intended use.

Differences in thought not only influence system design but may also lead to unforeseen negative consequences in technology’s real-world operation.

## Ambiguity of Technology and Its Negative Aspects

While diversity of thought shapes system design, the inherent characteristics of the technology itself can invite unintended uses.

When a proposed decentralized system might be repurposed in unexpected ways, it is essential to assess the risks and carefully consider its release. Due to their autonomous nature, decentralized systems are extremely difficult to fix once problems arise. For example, the Tor browser offers anonymity but has been linked to illegal activities like hiring hitmen or hacking—actions that should be prohibited in a libertarian economic zone as they violate others’ rights. Thus, mechanisms such as cryptographic trapdoors or operational safeguards must be explored to prevent uses that contradict the movement’s philosophy, with thorough discussions on violations preceding any public release.

## Principle of Adoption Based on Cultural Anthropological Rationality

To minimize the unintended consequences of a proposed system, it is vital to consider its cultural anthropological rationality. Historically, the widespread adoption of concepts like religion, money, nations, and securities has been underpinned by rationality. For instance, during the Age of Exploration, the concept of securities emerged in the Netherlands. Trade at the time entailed high costs and risks; while England relied on per-voyage accounting, the Netherlands introduced a mechanism akin to modern corporations, enabling efficient trade and profit distribution. Supported by merchants and industrialists, this system gained traction.

Likewise, proposing a new system requires providing rational incentives for use, taking into account current social conditions, technology acceptance, and how it will impact individuals and shift power dynamics. Cypherpunk and cryptographic system proposals may differ from business-driven needs, as they aim to establish mechanisms for social systems. This necessitates designing rules from political and economic perspectives. Historically, the Glorious Revolution shifted power from monarchs to merchants and industrialists, driven by a new social system concept. Today, libertarian thought, cryptography, and the internet hold the potential to transfer power from merchants and industrialists to individuals.

## Vertically Integrated Platform

For systems and ideas to gain widespread acceptance, reliance on protocols alone is insufficient—applications are equally essential. The internet did not spread through TCP/IP alone; it proliferated thanks to interfaces like browsers, applications like search engines, and economic incentives like the advertising model. Protocols designed for specific purposes require accompanying interfaces and applications to function effectively. Adoption accelerates when usability meets users’ tolerance levels. By integrating technologies like Bitcoin and Tor into user-friendly applications, value is generated in both technology and thought.

## Unresolved Issues

The following challenges warrant particular focus in future discussions:

- Significance of Libertarian Thought in Current Society
In the 1980s, the commercialization of the internet and centralized consumer data management by corporations and governments sparked vibrant debates about the internet’s form and privacy. What are today’s social challenges, and how do libertarian thought and cryptography address them? Reexamining the relevance of modern cypherpunk is essential.
- Completely Anonymous Routing System
Technical solutions to privacy issues, such as Hal Finney’s anonymous remailer and eavesdropping at Tor’s exit nodes, need exploration. Fundamentally, this is a challenge concerning protocols between relay routers in server-client communication.
- Order in an Anonymous Economy
Blockchain consensus relies on trustlessness rooted in mathematical facts, but transactions in an anonymous economy depend on trust based on economic rationality. We must examine the foundation for an anonymous economy and technical countermeasures to fraud, such as arbitrators or intermediaries absconding with funds.
- Economic Losses in the Bitcoin Network
In the physical world, a lost coin is either found or reclaimed by the government, but in Bitcoin, losing a private key renders an asset economically valueless semi-permanently. Solutions are needed to mitigate this economic loss and address storage pressure from small balances during transfers, potentially through incentives for micropayments and capacity reduction.
