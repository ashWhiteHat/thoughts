# Cypherpunks and Libertarians: The Dream and Reality of Anonymous Economics

## Abstract

The cypherpunk movement, driven by libertarians, sought to create an anonymous economic sphere on the internet, free from interference by governments and large corporations. However, the tools developed for this purpose—due to technical flaws or their limited appeal to the general public—have deviated from their intended ideals of freedom and autonomy. Instead, they have been repurposed for rights violations and self-serving interests, highlighting the limitations of a purely reason-based economic system. This suggests that the libertarian experiments in this domain may have ultimately failed.

## The cypherpunk movement and tools

The cypherpunk movement gained momentum in the 1990s, coinciding with the commercialization of the internet. A key platform for its development was the Cypherpunk mailing list, reportedly founded with contributions from figures like Timothy May and Eric Hughes. In Hughes' Cypherpunk Manifesto, privacy was framed as a cornerstone of free and autonomous activity in an open society. The manifesto stressed the necessity of anonymous transactions without reliance on governments or corporations, igniting widespread debate.

## Tools shift in purpose

Despite its origins, Bitcoin rose to prominence not as a tool for libertarian peer-to-peer transactions, but as a refuge currency during geopolitical upheavals like financial crises and the Cyprus crisis. On platforms like Silk Road, it briefly aligned with its intended use as an anonymous, unregulated transaction system. However, the arrest of Silk Road’s founder for contract killing, coupled with Tor’s association with serious crimes, exposed new challenges—namely, how anonymity can enable rights abuses and unchecked behavior.

## Integration into Traditional Finance

In recent years, Bitcoin has been embraced by traditional financial systems, with its inclusion in ETFs attracting institutional investors. The U.S. government has also supported regulatory frameworks to streamline its circulation. Ironically, Bitcoin, which was developed to avoid the mediation of governments and large corporations, has been regulated by governments and has become part of the speculative assets of traditional financial institutions.

## Challenges

The libertarian dream of a free and autonomous economy has been affected by external forces: geopolitical crises (e.g., financial instability), anonymity-driven crimes (e.g., Silk Road), and speculative financial interests. The lack of sustained demand for these tools’ intended purpose has led to economic instability, posing a persistent obstacle to achieving an open economy.

## A Failed Experiment?

This quest for a free and autonomous economy has veered into unintended territory, fueling selfish crimes that infringe on rights and bolstering the profits of traditional financial institutions—the very entities blamed for centralization. In light of this reality, the libertarians’ initial experiment appears to have fallen short of its goals.
