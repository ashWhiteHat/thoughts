# Abstract

Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency enabling pseudonymous online transactions without identifying individuals, facilitates anonymous transfers. However, the anonymity of transacting parties complicates trust-building, and the absence of legal recourse heightens the risk of fraud and disorderly transactions. Despite this, anonymous marketplaces such as Silk Road and AlphaBay exhibit a phenomenon where transaction reviews are overwhelmingly positive. This paper analyzes the trust-building mechanisms in anonymous economies, focusing on this counterintuitive phenomenon. Specifically, it examines mechanisms relying on trustworthiness rather than strict trustlessness, identifies unresolved challenges, and proposes directions for future research.
Information Asymmetry in Anonymous Markets
In anonymous marketplaces, the anonymity of transacting parties creates information asymmetry. The low reliability of reviews and the difficulty of legal recourse against fraud post-transaction make it challenging for buyers to distinguish high-quality goods, potentially leading to adverse selection, where high-quality sellers exit the market. Additionally, moral hazards arise, such as buyers falsely claiming non-delivery to demand refunds or sellers failing to ship goods after receiving payment. These are standard economic arguments used to explain the failure of anonymous marketplaces.
However, Silk Road achieved over 97.8% of transactions receiving four- or five-star ratings, demonstrating commercial success through significant transaction volumes. A similar trend is observed in its successor, AlphaBay. This phenomenon suggests that order and trust can be maintained in anonymous economies without relying on strict cryptographic or protocol-based trustlessness. These facts are repeatedly explained using the principles of games and signaling, the basis for trustworthiness is elucidated, and finally the unresolved issues are sorted out.

# Repeated Games

A repeated game is a mechanism in which cooperation is sustained through the expectation of future rewards derived from ongoing transactions, as opposed to one-shot transactions. In anonymous, one-shot transactions, the low cost of betrayal makes establishing cooperative relationships challenging. However, in anonymous marketplaces, sellers tend to adopt cooperative behavior, even under anonymity, to maximize future rewards through repeated transactions.
Sellers weigh the short-term gains from a single fraudulent act against the long-term benefits of sustained transactions. Betrayal leads to the loss of future transaction opportunities, effectively forfeiting expected profits, and is thus considered irrational. Consequently, based on the expectation of future rewards, sellers view cooperative behavior as a rational choice.

# Signaling Principles

A signal is an action that conveys private information to others. In anonymous marketplaces, signals include product descriptions, past transaction histories, and buyer reviews. By disclosing such information, these signals mitigate issues arising from information asymmetry and encourage cooperative behavior. Signals are classified by their cost, with higher-cost signals having a greater impact on trust-building.
High-cost signals, which are difficult or economically costly to forge, include transaction histories tied to a seller’s Bitcoin address and associated reviews. These signals are inversely correlated with fraudulent behavior. In contrast, low-cost signals, such as sincere product descriptions or transaction communications, have limited effectiveness in deterring fraud.
In summary, the tamper-resistance and transparency of on-chain information, such as a seller’s tenure in the marketplace and accumulated reviews, combined with effective escrow and account management by platform operators, enable cooperative relationships and maintain order in anonymous economies.

# Future Discussions

Despite these mechanisms, challenges persist in anonymous economic transactions. First, escrow systems or administrators pose a risk of exit scams, where funds entrusted to platform operators are misappropriated, creating a single point of failure. Second, the integrity of arbitration is problematic. When sellers and buyers make conflicting claims, platform-mediated arbitration is required, but anonymity complicates verifying the truth, making fully neutral and fact-based resolutions difficult. Finally, new entrants face barriers to entry. When trust relies solely on high-cost signals, establishing initial transactions is challenging, leaving newcomers at a disadvantage.
The first two challenges will be addressed by discussing cryptographic solutions and their limitations, while the final challenge will be explored through economic theory-based strategies in future work.
