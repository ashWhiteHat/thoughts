# The Transformation of Libertarianism Brought about by Cryptography and the Internet

## Overview

The fusion of cryptography and the internet has the potential to make ideologies such as libertarianism and anarchism more feasible and to bring about revolutionary changes in political systems. Cryptography extends the possibilities of the internet into the political and economic spheres, potentially becoming a historical turning point that addresses the structural challenges of traditional communities and order.

## Cryptography and the Internet

Cryptography provides a means to verify the correctness of information in the digital world. By converting economic concepts (such as signatures and the minting of metals) into mathematical propositions and making them executable by computers, it has become possible to simulate these activities on the internet. It functions as a foundational technology that safeguards the reliability of economic spheres in cyberspace, giving rise to new economic systems.

The internet is a platform that allows for anonymous participation, and cryptography guarantees the reliability of digital information. This combination enables the management of ownership and economic activities to be realized by nations or unspecified groups, constructing systems that transcend traditional frameworks.

## Crypto Economics

With the ability to manage information with properties of assets, it has become possible to apply economic incentives between anonymous parties. This method of maintaining order based on economic incentives replaces the traditional method of maintaining order through police force in the real-name economy.

In Bitcoin, an anonymous and stable economic sphere is realized by providing economic incentives for recording correct transactions. In fact, in El Salvador, Bitcoin was adopted as legal tender in 2021, enabling access to finance for the population in place of traditional financial institutions. Additionally, in countries such as Argentina that are struggling with inflation, payments using stablecoins on Ethereum are widely used in place of local currencies, and the crypto economy is being adopted to complement functions that were previously only provided by the state and large corporations.

These advancements are realized by:

- Public key cryptography replacing state-managed ownership,
- Electronic signatures replacing contracts for asset transfers,
- Proof of Work (PoW) replacing the mining of scarce tokens.

However, by replacing the core systems of political economy with cryptography, there is the potential to realize a broader complementary system for nations on the internet.

## Singularity in State Theory

In traditional states, conflicts of interest within communities have often been factors that undermine order. However, if crypto economics incentives are properly designed, cooperation can be promoted under specific game-theoretic conditions. Specifically, in decentralized systems using cryptography (such as blockchain), even if participants do not trust each other, cooperative behavior is encouraged through economic incentives and cryptographic guarantees, minimizing conflicts.

Furthermore, these technologies have for the first time created an environment where a minority with superior ideas can lead politics. In traditional state systems, top-down approval was necessary, and power and vested interests often hindered the introduction of new ideas. In contrast, systems utilizing cryptography allow for a bottom-up approach to reconstructing society. The internet has evolved from a mere means of information transmission to a field for social experimentation through crypto economics.

The combination of cryptography and the internet provides a new candidate solution to long-discussed governance issues. Traditional states have been bound by geography and ethnicity, with wars, corruption, mob rule, authority, and vested interests hindering the introduction of superior systems. Cryptography presents alternative means to some functions that were previously monopolized by states or large corporations, and this fact will accelerate discussions on competition for states as services and their necessity.

Against the constancy of the state as proposed by Norbert Wiener in cybernetics and the cyclical issues of communities seen in Plato's Republic, the design of communities based on cryptography and economics suggests new solutions. In traditional state systems, competition and maintaining order were difficult, but in systems utilizing cryptography, conflicts can be managed and order maintained through economic incentives and decentralized protocols. This makes grassroots transformation by a few superior proposals a reality, opening up a path to improve society through a different approach than before.

This new paradigm also has its challenges. Issues such as inequality, fraud, money laundering, as well as constraints like governance, legal regulations, energy consumption, and scalability, are cited. Unless these challenges are overcome, it will be difficult to fully realize the potential of these systems. Despite the remaining challenges, considering the innovativeness of their characteristics, there is no doubt that this is one of the most significant fields of technology.
