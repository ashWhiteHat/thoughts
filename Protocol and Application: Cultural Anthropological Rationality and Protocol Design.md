# Overview

The Cypherpunk movement led to the discovery of cryptoeconomics, replacing part of rules that were previously enforced by institutions such as governments and courts with cryptographic technology and computer protocols, enabling autonomous and decentralized operations. However, while discussions on execution technologies are active, there is a lack of debate on what rules should be established from what perspectives. In this paper, as part of our consideration of rule design, we focus on securities as rules in historical social systems and analyze what mechanisms were proposed based on the geopolitical context at the time and why they became widespread, using the example of Bitcoin.

# Protocols and Applications

Rousseau argued that the legitimacy of laws and governance should be designed in accordance with cultural and geopolitical backgrounds. Similarly, cryptographic and internet protocols need to be designed based on the general will of modern society. Cryptographic technology and computer protocols have different dissemination principles from applications. Applications are developed in response to market needs (market-in), whereas protocols function as mechanisms (social-in) to solve social problems and geopolitical challenges, requiring consideration of cultural anthropological rationality that society can accept.
Rationality of Securities
The mechanism of securities and joint-stock companies was proposed as a solution to the social problem of soaring pepper prices. This was driven by the legalization of financial interest and the development of financial markets. However, the significant risks associated with opening new trade routes necessitated a high-risk, high-return fundraising method distinct from banks, requiring a system to gather substantial funds and distribute profits from the business.
Evolution occurred simultaneously in multiple places; similar mechanisms were proposed in England, but they were limited to single investments per voyage. In contrast, the Netherlands adopted a flexible mechanism that treated all voyages over a certain period as a single business, which was close to the prototype of modern corporations and became widely adopted. This supported the Netherlands' rise to hegemony.
Securities were a mechanism to collect and distribute funds from investors with high risk tolerance for the ventures of adventurers and entrepreneurs. As a result, the Netherlands' national power increased through profits from the pepper trade, proving it to be a highly rational system.
Social Issue: Soaring pepper prices
Social Challenge: Lack of high-risk, high-return fundraising methods that can tolerate risks associated with voyages

- Geopolitical Factors: Rise in margins on Middle Eastern trade routes due to the weakening of the Byzantine Empire and the influence of the Ottoman Empire
- Solution: Opening new trade routes
- Measures: Invention of securities and stocks

# Rationality of Bitcoin

In response to financial crises caused by credit issues in centralized financial institutions, such as the misrepresentation of subprime loan risks and leverage in derivative transactions, as well as the erosion of ownership rights over assets and trust in financial systems due to national deposit freezes, Bitcoin provides a mechanism for ownership and asset management that does not generate inflation and cannot be stopped by anyone. Rule enforcement is distributed and managed by anonymous participants, creating a system where individual rights are not infringed upon by power.
Bitcoin provides access to financial services for people living in countries where centralized financial institutions are problematic. Miners who manage these systems can profit from rising token values and fees as more people from various countries use it as a risk-hedging tool. Furthermore, the expansion of the crypto economy generates network effects, enabling new value-providing mechanisms such as anonymous marketplaces.
Social Issue: Inflation and deposit freezes caused by centralized finance
Social Challenge: Inability to transfer bank deposits or infringement on ownership freedom due to sudden rule changes such as taxation

- Geopolitical Factors: Abuse of derivative transactions and active currency issuance by governments
- Solution: Asset management methods without intermediaries like large corporations or governments
- Measures: Token mining and ownership management using cryptographic technology, and decentralized transfer systems via P2P

# Social-In

A social system is ideally like a dynamic converter that directs individual self-interest toward the interests of the entire community. While applications respond to needs, protocols respond to cultural anthropological rationality. To design them, it is necessary to consider societal technological progress, changes in geopolitical power relations, social problems, and individual dynamics. In other words, in protocol design, the spirit of the law is upstream, with technology downstream as the means to realize it. Insights into geopolitics, economics, and politics are essential for writing good "code."
