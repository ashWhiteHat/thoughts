# Pseudonymity and Anonymity

## Pseudonymity

Pseudonymity refers to an anonymity level where identifiers (e.g., user IDs or wallet addresses) not directly linked to real names are used. It is possible to track behavioral history (e.g., posts or transaction records) associated with these identifiers, and personal identification may be feasible by combining external information such as IP addresses or KYC data from exchanges. Examples include social networking services (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) that allow registration with usernames and Bitcoin wallet addresses. In Bitcoin, transaction history can be traced through the public blockchain ledger, classifying it as pseudonymous.

## Anonymity

Anonymity refers to an anonymity level where no personal identifying information, such as real names or addresses, is linked. Behavioral history is not associated with individuals, making tracking or personal identification extremely difficult. For example, Zcash's shielded transactions use zero-knowledge proofs to conceal the sender, recipient, and amount, qualifying as anonymous.
